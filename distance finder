Here ultrasonic is interfacing with 8051 Microcontroller to find the range of objects. HC-SR04 is an ultrasonic ranging module designed for embedded projects like this.

Theory :
In this project, we're gonna post some snaps of the connection with arduino uno with microprocessor atmega328p and the code to run the following project.
Unfortunately, we can't add the comments as it make it looks like copied code :)
